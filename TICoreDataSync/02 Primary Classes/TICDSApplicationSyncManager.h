/** `TICDSDocumentSyncManager` describes the generic behavior provided by an Application Sync Manager in the `TICoreDataSync` framework.
 
 The Application Sync Manager is responsible for application-wide synchronization settings. You typically have only one in an application.
 
 Don't instantiate this class directly, but instead use one of the subclasses:
 
 1. `TICDSFileManagerBasedApplicationSyncManager`
 2. `TICDSDropboxSDKBasedApplicationSyncManager`
 
 @warning You must register the application sync manager before you can use it to perform any other tasks, or register any documents.

/** Register an application ready for future synchronization.
 
 Use this method to register the sync manager ready for document registration and synchronization (via `TICDSDocumentSyncManager` objects).
 
 This will automatically spawn a `TICDSApplicationRegistrationOperation`, and notify you of progress through the `TICDSApplicationSyncManagerDelegate` methods.
 
 If this is the first time you have registered a client with this app identifier, registration will automatically create the file structure necessary at the remote end for this and other clients to synchronize. See `[TICDSUtilities remoteGlobalAppDirectoryHierarchy]` for the structure that will be created.
 
 @param aDelegate The object you wish to be notified regarding application-related sync information; this object must conform to the `TICDSApplicationSyncManagerDelegate` protocol, which includes some required methods.
 @param anAppIdentifier The identification string used to identify the synchronization information across multiple clients. If you wish to be able to synchronize Mac and iOS, this app identifier should be the same on both platforms. This identifier will also be used as the root level of the remote file structure.
 @param aClientIdentifier An identification string for this client. Every client wishing to synchronize must have a string to identify itself (i.e., the application instance on a machine) uniquely. You would typically create a UUID string the first time your app is launched and store this in preferences.
 @param aClientDescription A human-readable string used to identify this client, e.g. the computer name.
 @param someUserInfo A dictionary of information that will be saved throughout all future synchronizations. Because this information is saved in a plist, everything in the dictionary must be archivable. */
