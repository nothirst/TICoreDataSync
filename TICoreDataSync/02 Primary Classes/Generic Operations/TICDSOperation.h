/**
 The `TICDSOperation` class provides the abstract behavior typical of any operation used by the `TICoreDataSync` framework.
 
 All `TICoreDataSync` operations are (in Apple terms) concurrent, which means that they return `YES` for `isConcurrent`. This means they may be used by classes using e.g. `NSURLConnection` or custom rest clients to fetch information in the background.
 
 Subclasses should make use of the operation phase methods listed below to update the values of `isExecuting` and `isFinished` so that operation queues can keep track of them. The `operationDidStart` method is called automatically when the operation begins to execute.
 
 Subclasses of `TICDSOperation` should override `needsMainThread` to return `YES` if they require their tasks to be implemented on the main thread.
 
 The `start` method automatically sets up the operation and notifies its `delegate` that it started. Subclasses should override `main` to do their work.
 
 If an operation needs to create temporary files on disk during execution, it can call `tempFileDirectoryPath` to get access to a directory created specifically for the operation. This directory (and its contents) will automatically be removed from disk once the operation calls one of the completion methods.
 
 @warning Subclasses must call one of the `operationDidCompleteSuccessfully`, `operationDidFailToComplete` or `operationWasCancelled` to update the delegate and set the necessary values such that the operation be removed from the operation queue.
