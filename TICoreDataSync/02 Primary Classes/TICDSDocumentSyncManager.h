/** `TICDSDocumentSyncManager` describes the generic behavior provided by a Document Sync Manager in the `TICoreDataSync` framework.
 
 A Document Sync Manager is responsible for synchronization settings relating to a single document--you'll need one for each document you wish to synchronize. If your application is a non-document-based application, you'll still need a single document sync manager to represent your application's data.
 
 Don't instantiate this class directly, but instead use one of the subclasses:
 
 1. `TICDSFileManagerBasedDocumentSyncManager`
 2. `TICDSDropboxSDKBasedDocumentSyncManager`
 3. `TICDSiCloudBasedDocumentSyncManager`
 
 @warning You must register the document sync manager before you can use it to synchronize the document, or perform any other tasks. */

/** Register a document ready for synchronization.
 
 Use this method to register the sync manager ready for document synchronization.
 
 This will automatically spawn a `TICDSDocumentRegistrationOperation`, and notify you of progress through the `TICDSDocumentSyncManagerDelegate` methods.
 
 If this is the first time you have registered the document with this identifier, registration will automatically create the file structure necessary at the remote end for this and other clients to synchronize. See `[TICDSUtilities remoteDocumentFileStructure]` for the structure that will be created.
 
 If you provide an application sync manager that isn't yet ready to sync, the document registration task will be suspended until the application has finished registering.
 
 If this is the first time you have registered this document, or the remote file structure has been removed for some reason, your delegate will be notified with the `documentSyncManager:didPauseRegistrationAsRemoteFileStructureDoesNotExistForDocumentWithIdentifier:description:userInfo:` method. You must continue registration manually by calling the `continueRegistrationByCreatingRemoteFileStructure:` method.
 
 @warning You must call this method before using the document sync manager for any other purpose.
 
 @param aDelegate The object you wish to be notified regarding document-related sync information; this object must conform to the `TICDSDocumentSyncManagerDelegate` protocol, which includes some required methods.
 @param anAppSyncManager The application sync manager responsible for overseeing this document.
 @param aContext The primary managed object context in your application; this must be an instance of `NSManagedObjectContext` whose synchronized property is set to YES.
 @param aDocumentIdentifier An identification string to identify this document uniquely. You would typically create a UUID string the first time this doc is registered and store this in e.g. the store metadata.
 @param aDocumentDescription A human-readable string used to identify this document, e.g. the full name of the document.
 @param someUserInfo A dictionary of information that will be saved throughout all future synchronizations. Because this information is saved in a plist, everything in the dictionary must be archivable using `NSKeyedArchiver`.
